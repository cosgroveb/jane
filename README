jane: just another erlang bot

Description

jane is an Erlang XMPP bot I'm working on to teach myself the basics of Erlang and
OTP.

jane hangs out in Multi-User Chat and responds to pre-defined commands. Right now,
all it does is execute shell commands and return the result in an XMPP message.


The commands it responds to are defined in jane.app.src (this needs to go into a
separate configuration file). In the commands tuple, the format is
{"alias","command args"} where the alias is the command you send to jane in a chat
message like:

>jane: date


Installation (assuming you already have Erlang, at least R12)


First, configure jane's connection settings by editing src/jane.app.src.


Then:


>cd jane
>./rebar clean compile generate


If the previous step fails to include xmpp, get it from https://github.com/processone/exmpp,
and install it. Next, if you had to install xmpp yourself:


>./rebar clean compile generate


Now, since our release wasn't fully generated, we'll start jane manually:


>erl -pa ebin


>1>application:start(jane).
>ok.
>2>jane_server:join_chat().
>joining_chat.


There aren't any tests yet. 


Todos


* Tests
* ???
* Profit!
* Take advantage of concurrency by moving the logic to handle commands and return XMPP output into workers

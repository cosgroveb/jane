# jane: just another erlang bot

## Description

jane is an Erlang XMPP bot I'm working on to teach myself the basics of Erlang and
OTP.

jane hangs out in Multi-User Chat and responds to pre-defined commands. Right now,
all it does is execute shell commands and return the result in an XMPP message.


The commands it responds to are defined in jane.app.src (this needs to go into a
separate configuration file). In the commands tuple, the format is
{"alias","command args"} where the alias is the command you send to jane in a chat
message like:

>jane: date


## Installation (assuming you already have Erlang, at least R12)


First, configure jane's connection settings by editing src/jane.app.src.


Installation and running jane is tricky so far. I haven't got rebar building
releases (or pulling dependencies??) correctly, yet. You'll probably have to
do something like this:


>cd jane
>./rebar clean compile generate


If the previous step fails to include xmpp, get it from https://github.com/processone/exmpp,
and install it. Next, if you had to install xmpp yourself:


>./rebar clean compile generate
(this will give an error, but will compile the beam files we need to run jane)


Now, since our release wasn't fully generated, we'll start jane manually:


>erl -pa ebin


>1>application:start(jane).
>ok.
>2>jane_server:join_chat().
>joining_chat.


That's it. I really don't recommend doing all that until I get the rebar stuff figured out.


Oh, and there aren't any tests yet. I'm not adding any more code until I've got some tests.


## Todos


* Get rebar or reltools working properly with this project
* Tests
* ???
* Profit!
* Take advantage of concurrency by moving the logic to handle commands and return XMPP
output into workers
